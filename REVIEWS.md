> ----- TEXT:
> This is a great session submission. I feel that sometimes tooling gets a back seat to fancy new features, but having used build and packaging systems in other languages, I think we have a way to go.
> 
> If there anything you can add from your experience on the impact of solid tooling to the adoption of a language and community engagement/growth? There is certainly the technical aspect, which it appears you are covering well, but there is also a more community aspect - is there anything more we can be doing to ensure that C++ will be attractive to new developer? What is the common expectation on such tooling in other communities?
> 
> Perhaps you are already planing on covering it a little with the comments on the Rust language traction?

> Choosing a build system is a decision every C++ programmer has to make. I'm really interested to see an introduction of all the major build systems that supports C++, their biggest strength, and how does Cmake compare to them.
> 
> I notice one area the outline does not touch is projects with mixed languages. For example, mobile apps often needs to mix Java/Kotlin/C++ (Android), or ObjC/Swift/C++ (iOS). Would Cmake still be the best choice for  C++ code in mixed language projects?

> ----- TEXT:
> In many domains SBOM and similar are now a compliance requirement to ship software. Modernizing a big, non-trivial code base like LLVM to add those features is definitely of interest of many people who needs to introduce similar features into their own build system. I think this submission is to the point and is of great interest for a wide range of audience.

> ----- TEXT:
> The talk looks intriguing thanks to the hot topic of safe language and, probably already not so hot, but still important topics like fuzzing. It also covers a new (at least for me) build system with good comparison with the well-known CMake and seems will provide a lot of technical details.

> I know that it is catchy to talk about "successors" now that they are trendy for C++ itself, but I think it is a bit misleading for build systems, and it would be better to avoid it. Besides Meson and Bazel the other alternatives have been around for a long time, and they do not seem to be creating any new excitement or getting new traction, so I would certainly not call any of those other build systems "successors" to CMake, and the trend from my point of view is not indicating that.
> 
> This doesn't make the topic and the proposal less interesting, there are tons of things to learn and discuss from all those build systems, and it is worth talking about them.
> 
> Also, I have the feeling that the proposal might be hitting the most common issue in https://cppcon.org/submissions/ and "try to cover too much material". Each one of the topics of point 4) in the outline feels a talk by itself, and point 3) in the outline would also be more than enough for the talk.
> 
> If I had to choose, I'd go for the hermetic builds, remote builds, static and dynamic code analysis and linting. Dependency Management is a more common topic nowadays that some popular dependency and package management solutions exist (if the talk will include it, I'd definitely discuss them, in the same way the different build systems are discussed. But as said, I think this would be really too much for 1h)

> The speaker seems to know the topic and possibly is even an expert in the field of build systems. there are many valid points that aren't covered elsewhere as much as they probably deserve despite that they affect larger companies more than small shops or individuals.
> 
> The focus on CMake is probably the right call.
> I see build system in the list that are new to me, and I miss build systems like 'build2' or 'xmake' that are probably more relevant than others.
