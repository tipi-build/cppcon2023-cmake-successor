						<h2>Parallelism</h2>
						<h3>How many indipendent targets can a build system run concurrently at most?</h3>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Parallelism</h2>
						<h3>Level 1 - Gradle</h3>
						<pre>
.
├── app
│   ...
│   └── build.gradle
├── lib
│   ...
│   └── build.gradle
└── settings.gradle
						</pre>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Parallelism</h2>
						<h3>Level 1 - Gradle</h3>
						<p>
							Sub-project level parallelism. It is very limited as projects have very low granularity
							and are limited in numbers. It is disabled by default
						</p>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Parallelism</h2>
						<h3>Level 2 - Make, FASTBuild</h3>
						<p>
							Targets are more granular and the size of the job pool can be specified by a flag (-j/--jobs)
						</p>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Parallelism</h2>
						<h3>Level 3 - Bazel</h3>
						<p>
							Same as the level before, but resource-intensive targets can reduce the level of parallelism on-demand 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Parallelism</h2>
						<h3>Level 4 - Ninja</h3>
						<p>
							You can define separate job-pools each of which with a different size (eg: link=1 and cc=16)
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>

					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Caching</h2>
						<h3>How many targets can a build system avoid rebuilding?</h3>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Caching</h2>
						<h3>Level 1 - Gradle</h3>
						<p>
							Once again the low level of granularity means that even small changes will rebuild very large targets
						</p>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Caching</h2>
						<h3>Level 2 - Make, Ninja</h3>
						<p>
							Check timestamps on the individual input files and rebuild targets if any change. Caching is completely 
							file-system based and uses the mtime of a file to detect if it has changed since the last build
						</p>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Caching</h2>
						<h3>Level 3 - FASTBuild</h3>
						<p>
							Supports the same type of file-system caching as the previous level and adds support for distributed 
							caching
						</p>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Caching</h2>
						<h3>Level 4 - Bazel</h3>
						<p>
							Supports file-system and distributed caching as with the previous level, but based on the digest of the input files' 
							content rather than mtime. Bazel also has an in-memory cache for large build graphs 
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>

					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
						<h3>Given the same inputs and configuration, a target should yield identical outputs</h3>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
						<h3>Level 1 - Make, Ninja, FASTBuild</h3>
						<p>
							Provide no real facility to ensure reproducibility and, thus, hermeticity is something
							that the developers have to take care of
						</p>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
						<h3>Level 2 - Meson</h3>
						<p>
							Allows you to query and introspect tools during a build and configure them to get 
							reproducibile results as well as define toolchains
						</p>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
						<h3>Level 3 - Gradle</h3>
						<p>
							Predefines robust and easy to configure toolchains out of the box. This way builds do not normally rely
							on any system-wide installed tools/libraries that can change between different workstations
						</p>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
						<h3>Level 4 - Bazel</h3>
						<p>
							Toolchains are treated as normal inputs. This trivially allows defining custom toolchains 
							whilst keeping the same level of reproducibility
						</p>
					</section>

						<h2>Distributed/remote builds</h2>
						<h3>The ability of a build system to cache and/or run targets on a shared distributed system</h3>
					</section>

						<h2>Distributed/remote builds</h2>
						<h3>The ability of a build system to cache and/or run targets on a shared distributed system</h3>
						<sub>* also the thing that pays for my salary :)</sub>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Distributed builds</h2>
						<h3>Level 1 - Make, Ninja, Meson</h3>
						<p>
							No distributed caching or execution out of the box, everything runs locally
						</p>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
						<h3>Level 2 - Gradle</h3>
						<p>
							Has support for remote caching, but no remote execution of build targets. Once again the low level of 
							granularity negatively impacts the potential of this feature
						</p>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
						<h3>Level 3 - FASTBuild</h3>
						<p>
							Supports both distributed execution and caching, however it is limited to just a list of well-known 
							compilers when it comes to remote execution
						</p>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
						<h3>Level 4 - Bazel</h3>
						<p>
							Supports both distributed builds and caching for arbitrary tools, including compilers, linkers, tests
							and whatever you can think of
						</p>
